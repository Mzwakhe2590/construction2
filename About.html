                    Our projects are substantially quicker to build than conventional construction 
                    schemes, often resulting in a 50% â€“ 60% time saving on programme. Our method also 
                    results in significantly less disruption onsite with up to 80% fewer vehicle 
                    movements, a reduction in onsite resources and reduced waste when compared to 
                    traditional methods of construction. All our projects are fully fundable, 
                    mortgageable and insurable.</p>
